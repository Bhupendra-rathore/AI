🏏 The Symphony of Willow and Leather

In fields where silence holds its breath,
A ball cuts through with graceful death.
The bowler storms, a force, a flare,
The batsman stands with steady stare.

A crack! The willow sings its song,
The ball flies high, the cheer is strong.
It soars beyond the boundary rope,
A sixer built on skill and hope.

The spinner weaves his mystic spell,
A dance of drift — where secrets dwell.
The batter shifts, unsure, then tries,
A miss! The stumps light up the skies.

The crowd erupts in rising waves,
For heroes born from dusty graves.
A dive, a leap, a stubborn stand,
All written by a bowler’s hand.

Each over spun, a tale unfolds,
Of rival hearts and dreams made bold.
Through sun and sweat, through dusk and dew,
The game reveals what men can do.

And when the final run is made,
Or last man falls beneath the blade,
The field still echoes, loud and clear—
Of cricket, king of sport and cheer.
